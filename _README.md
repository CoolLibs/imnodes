### Grid space

This is the space where the nodes and link live. It is independant of any transformation applied by the user.

### Editor space

This is what happens to grid space after zoom and pan have been applied. This space corresponds th what you see on screen in the editor window.

### Screen space

Same as Editor Space, except that it has been translated so that the origin is now the corner of the screen instead of the corner of the ImGui window.
